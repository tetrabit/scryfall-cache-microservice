# Code of Conduct

This project is committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive environment for everyone who participates.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate in language and actions
- Assuming good intent and focusing on collaboration
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Prioritizing what is best for the project and its users

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by opening an issue in this repository. If you need to report something sensitive, open an issue with minimal detail and request a private follow-up.

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action.

## Enforcement Guidelines

When responding to a Code of Conduct report, maintainers will consider:

- **Impact**: effect on individuals and the community
- **Context**: intent does not erase impact
- **Pattern**: whether this is repeated behavior

Corrective actions may include a warning, temporary ban, or permanent ban from project spaces.
